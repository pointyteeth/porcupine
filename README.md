Tech Draft Application: Team Porcupine

A major drawback of the existing application is that the applications and projects was not filled up and it would be beneficial to atuomatically bring these projects into the application.

As Github has become the primary place for coders to host projects, this new code will automatically fill up many of the projects that the user has worked on.

With the new application, it will automatically use your Github id and then pull the crucial information from the user's Github account ranging from the number of their public repos, the descriptions, number of watchers and size of the repo code.
